1.6 Ideals for programmers

correctness, reliability, well designed, affordable

This line of thinking leads to the idea that “programming is understanding”:
when you can program a task, you understand it. Conversely, when you under-
stand a task thoroughly, you can write a program to do it. In other words, we
can see programming as part of an effort to thoroughly understand a topic. A
program is a precise representation of our understanding of a topic.

When you program, you spend significant time trying to understand the task
you are trying to automate.

...

Programming is part practical, part theoretical. If you are just practical, you
will produce non-scalable, unmaintainable hacks. If you are just theoretical,
you will produce unusable (or unaffordable) toys.
