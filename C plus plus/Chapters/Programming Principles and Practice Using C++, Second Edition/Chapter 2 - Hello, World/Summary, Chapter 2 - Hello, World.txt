Errors found by the compiler are called compile-time errors, errors found by the
linker are called link-time errors, and errors not found until the program is run are
called run-time errors or logic errors. Generally, compile-time errors are easier to un-

and fix than run-time errors and logic errors.

You might think you understand everything you read and everything your
Mentor or instructor told you, but repetition and practice are necessary to de-
velop programming skills. In this regard, programming is like athletics, music,
dance, or any skill-based craft. Imagine people trying to compete in any of those
fields without regular practice. You know how well they would perform. Constant
practice — for professionals that means lifelong constant practice — is the only way
to develop and maintain a high-level practical skill.
