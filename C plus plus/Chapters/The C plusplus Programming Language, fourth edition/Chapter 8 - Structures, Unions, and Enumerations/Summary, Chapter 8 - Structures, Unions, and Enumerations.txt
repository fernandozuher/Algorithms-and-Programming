8.1 Introduction
	The key to effective use of C++ is the definition and use of user-defined types. This chapter introduces the three most primitive variants of the notion of a user-defined type:
		• A struct (a structure) is a sequence of elements (called members) of arbitrary types.
		• A union is a struct that holds the value of just one of its elements at any one time.
		• An enum (an enumeration) is a type with a set of named constants (called enumerators).
		• enum class (a scoped enumeration) is an enum where the enumerators are within the scope of the enumeration and no implicit conversions to other types are provided.

8.2 Structures

	When p is a pointer, p−>m is equivalent to (∗p).m.

	8.2.1 struct Layout

		Members are allocated in memory in declaration order...

		However, the size of an object of a struct is not necessarily the sum of the sizes of its members. This is because many machines require objects of certain types to be allocated on architecture-dependent boundaries or handle such objects much more efficiently if they are. For example, integers are often allocated on word boundaries. On such machines, objects are said to have to be properly aligned (§6.2.9). This leads to ‘‘holes’’ in the structures.

		You can minimize wasted space by simply ordering members by size (largest member first).
		For example:
		struct Readout {
			int value;
			char hour;
			char seq;
		};
		This would give us 8 bytes.


		struct Readout {
			char hour;
			int value;
			char seq;
		};
		In this case, as on many machines, sizeof(Readout) is 12, and not 6 as one would naively expect from simply adding the sizes of the individual members.

		It is usually best to order members for readability and sort them by size only if there is a demonstrated need to optimize.

		Use of multiple access specifiers (i.e., public, private, or protected) can affect layout (§20.5).


	8.2.2 struct Names
		For reasons that reach into the prehistory of C, it is possible to declare a struct and a non- struct with the same name in the same scope. For example:
			struct stat { /* ... */ };
			int stat(char∗ name, struct stat∗ buf);

		In that case, the plain name ( stat ) is the name of the non- struct , and the struct must be referred to with the prefix struct. Similarly, the keywords class, union (§8.3), and enum (§8.4) can be used as prefixes for disambiguation. However, it is best not to overload names to make such explicit disambiguation necessary.


	8.2.3 Structures and Classes
		A struct is simply a class where the members are public by default. So, a struct can have member functions (§2.3.2, Chapter 16). In particular, a struct can have constructors.

		You do not need to define a constructor simply to initialize members in order.

		Constructors are needed if you need to reorder arguments, validate arguments, modify arguments, establish invariants (§2.4.3.2, §13.4), etc.

		struct Address {
			string name; 			// "Jim Dandy"
			int number; 			// 61
			string street; 			// "South St"
			string town; 			// "New Providence"
			char state[2]; 			// ’N’ ’J’
			char zip[5]; 			// 07974
			
			Address(const string n, int nu, const string& s, const string& t, const string& st, int z);
		};

		Here, I added a constructor to ensure that every member was initialized and to allow me to use a string and an int for the postal code, rather than fiddling with individual characters.


	8.2.7 Fields
		Surprisingly, using fields to pack several variables into a single byte does not necessarily save space. It saves data space, but the size of the code needed to manipulate these variables increases on most machines. Programs have been known to shrink significantly when binary variables were converted from bit-fields to characters! Furthermore, it is typically much faster to access a char or an int than to access a field. Fields are simply a convenient shorthand for using bitwise logical operators (§11.1.1) to extract information from and insert information into part of a word.


8.3 Unions
	A union is a struct in which all members are allocated at the same address so that the union occupies only as much space as its largest member. Naturally, a union can hold a value for only one member at a time.

	Use of unions can be essential for compactness of data and through that for performance. However, most programs don’t improve much from the use of unions and unions are rather error-prone. Consequently, I consider unions an overused feature; avoid them when you can.


8.4 Enumerations
	An enumeration is a type that can hold a set of integer values specified by the user (§iso.7.2). Some of an enumeration’s possible values are named and called enumerators. For example:
		enum class Color {red, green, blue};

	This defines an enumeration called Color with the enumerators red , green , and blue . ‘‘An enumeration’’ is colloquially shortened to ‘‘an enum .’’
	
	There are two kinds of enumerations:
		[1] enum class es, for which the enumerator names (e.g., red ) are local to the enum and their values do not implicitly convert to other types 
		[2] ‘‘Plain enum s,’’ for which the enumerator names are in the same scope as the enum and their values implicitly convert to integers
		
	In general, prefer the enum classes because they cause fewer surprises.


8.5 Advice
	[1] When compactness of data is important, lay out structure data members with larger members before smaller ones; §8.2.1.
	[2] Use bit-fields to represent hardware-imposed data layouts; §8.2.7.
	[3] Don’t naively try to optimize memory consumption by packing several values into a single byte; §8.2.7.
	[4] Use unions to save space (represent alternatives) and never for type conversion; §8.3.
	[5] Use enumerations to represent sets of named constants; §8.4.
	[6] Prefer class enums over ‘‘plain’’ enums to minimize surprises; §8.4.
	[7] Define operations on enumerations for safe and simple use; §8.4.1.
