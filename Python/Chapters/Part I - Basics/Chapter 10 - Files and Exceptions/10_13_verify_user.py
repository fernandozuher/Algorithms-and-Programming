# 10-13. Verify User: The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the
# user has already entered their username or that the program is running for the
# first time. We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who
# last used the program.

# Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), ask the user if
# this is the correct username. If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the correct
# username.
