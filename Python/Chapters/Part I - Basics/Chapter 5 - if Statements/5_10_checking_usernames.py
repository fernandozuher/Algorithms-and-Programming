# 5-10. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates
# how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.

# • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users .

# • Make another list of five usernames called new_users . Make sure one or
# two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

# • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already
# been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
# new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
# that the username is available.

# • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
# 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, you’ll need to make a copy of
# current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)

current_users = ['matheus', 'marcos', 'joão', 'paulo', 'pedro']
new_users = ['isaque', 'zaquarias', 'malaquias', 'Paulo', 'Pedro']
new = False

for new_user in new_users:
	if new_user.lower() in current_users:
		print(f"The username {new_user} has already been used. Enter another one.")
	else:
		print(f"The username {new_user} is available.")
