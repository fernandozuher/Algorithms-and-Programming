Introduction

Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also help you write “clean” code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages. People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web applications, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of interesting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.
