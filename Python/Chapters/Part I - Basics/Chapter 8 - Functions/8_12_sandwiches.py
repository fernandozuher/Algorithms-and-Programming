# 8-12. Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a list of items a person wants
# on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many
# items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sand-
# wich thatâ€™s being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different num-
# ber of arguments each time.
