# 10-2. Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a
# string with a different word. Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace
# 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:

# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'

# Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and
# replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print
# each modified line to the screen.

filename = 'learning_python.txt'
with open(filename) as file_object:
	for line in file_object:
		print(line.replace('Python', 'C').rstrip())
