# 6-12. Extensions: Weâ€™re now working with examples that are complex enough
# that they can be extended in any number of ways. Use one of the example pro-
# grams from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values, chang-
# ing the context of the program or improving the formatting of the output.

# Store information about pizzas being ordered.

	'fernando':
		{'crust': 'normal',
		'toppings': ['catupiry (Brazilian cream cheese)', 'chicken'],
		'price': '30'

# Summarize the orders.
