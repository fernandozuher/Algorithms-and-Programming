# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
# information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
# albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the
# album information correctly.
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to
# store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for
# the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least
# one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.
