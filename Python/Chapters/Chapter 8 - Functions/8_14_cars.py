# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a diction-
# ary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
# should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the func-
# tion with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
# color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:

	# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)

# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
# stored correctly.

def car_properties(manufacturer, model_name, **others):
	others['manufacturer'] = manufacturer
	others['model_name'] = model_name
	return others

print(car_properties('fiat', 'idea', color='white', tow_package=True))
