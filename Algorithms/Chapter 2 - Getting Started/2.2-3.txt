2.2-3 Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in Θ-notation? Justify your answers.

Assuming each element in the array is equally likely to be the key: first_element (1 checked element)/n + second_element (2 checked elements)/n + ... + last_element (n checked elements)/n = (n(n+1)/2) / n = (n + 1) / 2
	Average-case: (n+1)/2 -> n/2 -> Θ(n)

The worst case will happen when the key is not present, when all elements are checked plus when the test in the for/while loop is executed one time more than the loop body. So:
Worst-case: n + 1 -> n -> Θ(n)
