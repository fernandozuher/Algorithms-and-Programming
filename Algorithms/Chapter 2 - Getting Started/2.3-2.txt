2.3-2 Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.

MERGE(A, p, q, r)
	n1 = q - p + 1
	n2 = r - q
	let L[1..n1] and R[1..n2] be new arrays

	for i = 1 to n1
		L[i] = A[p + i - 1]

	for j = 1 to n2
		R[j] = A[q + j]

	i = 1
	j = 1
	k = p

	while i <= n1 and j <= n2

		if L[i] <= R[j]
			A[k] = L[i]
			i = i + 1
			
		else A[k] = R[j]
			j = j + 1

		k = k + 1

	if i > n1
		while j <= n2
			A[k] = R[j]
			j = j + 1
			k = k + 1
	else
		while i <= n1
			A[k] = L[i]
			i = i + 1
			k = k + 1
