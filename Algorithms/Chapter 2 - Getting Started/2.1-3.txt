2.1-3 Consider the searching problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers A = {a1, a2,....an} and a value v.
Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)
	for i = 1 to A.length
		if A[i] == v
			return i
	return NIL
