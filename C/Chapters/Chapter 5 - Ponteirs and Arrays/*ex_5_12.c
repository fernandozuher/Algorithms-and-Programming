Exercise 5-12. Extend entab and detab to accept the shorthand
	entab -m +n

to mean tab stops every n columns, starting at column m. Choose convenient
(for the user) default behavior

	They are about the previous exercise (5-11), 1-20 and 1-21 (chapter 1), page 34, PDF 48.
	I didn't do them in chapter 1 because it is not clear for me:
	 "...to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of
			tab stops, say every n columns."
