Exercise 5-11. Modify the programs entab and detab (written as exercises in
Chapter 1) to accept a list of tab stops as arguments. Use the default tab
settings if there are no arguments.
*/
	They are about the exercises 1-20 and 1-21, page 34, PDF 48.
	I didn't do them in chapter 1 because it is not clear for me:
	 "...to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of
			tab stops, say every n columns."
