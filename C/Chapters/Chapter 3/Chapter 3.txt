The continue statement is often used when the part of the loop that follows is
complicated, so that reversing a test and indenting another level would nest the
program too deeply.

C provides the infinitely-abusable goto statement, and labels to branch to.
Formally, the goto is never necessary, and in practice it is almost always easy
to write code without it. We have not used goto in this book.

Nevertheless, there are a few situations where gotos may find a place. The
most common is to abandon processing in some deeply nested structure, such as
breaking out of two or more loops at once. The break statement cannot be
used directly since it only exits from the innermost loop. Thus:

for ( ...)
	for ( ...) {
		if (disaster)
			goto error;
		}

error:
	clean up the mess

With a few exceptions like those cited here, code that relies on qoto state-
ments is generally harder to understand and to maintain than code without
qotos. Although we are not dogmatic about the matter, it does seem that
qoto statements should be used rarely, if at all.
