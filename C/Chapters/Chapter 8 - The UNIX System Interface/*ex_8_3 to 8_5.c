Exercise 8-3. Design and write _flushbuf, fflush, and fclose.

Exercise 8-4. The standard library function

	int fseek(FILE *fp, long offset, int origin)

is identical to Iseek except that fp is a file pointer instead of a file descriptor
and the return value is an int status, not a position. Write fseek. Make sure
that your fseek coordinates properly with the buffering done for the other
functions of the library.

Exercise 8-5. Modify the fsize program to print the other information con-
tained in the inode entry.

	Nope, annoying.
